When building for ServiceWorker I use a bunch of links to help me get started and understand ServiceWorkers and the other APIs which help make them work. Please check these out to help you build apps, and suggest links in a PR!

## Implementation Updates

* [Is Service Worker Ready Yet](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) - Jake Archibald made a great website which details ServiceWorker implementations across the major browsers.
* [ServiceWorkers and Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/serviceworkers-and-firefox/) - Introduction to ServiceWorkers on Firefox!

## Debugging

* [ServiceWorkerInternals (chrome canary only)](chrome://serviceworker-internals/) - page for debugging ServiceWorkers in chrome, including stopping, unregistering and starting workers.

## Examples

* [Jake Archibald's Trained to Thrill](https://jakearchibald.github.io/trained-to-thrill/) - Jake made a great demo app which pulls in images from Flickr, uses fetch, uses cache (not implemented yet) and worker registrations.
* [Simple ServiceWorker](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/serviceworker-simple) - A simple Service Worker example by Matt Andrews.

## Other APIs

* [Promises HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) - Understanding Promises (used frequently in ServiceWorkers especially in fetch, cache).
