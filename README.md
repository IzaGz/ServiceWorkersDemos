# Service Workers example apps
In this project, we hope to build a set of reference applications that make use of service workers. 

Our goal is to show how you can perform tasks that are common in native applications using this new set of APIs. We want to keep the apps simple, so they can be easily bisected and copied by anyone.

## WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED
Sorry about going all caps there, but these are all in the earliest stage of development. We are looking for people to help us! Nothing works right now.

### How can you help? 
We need you to help us build these things! If you wish to get to work on some of these items then fantastic! The process below is a guideline to how to get started.

1. Fork this repo! 
1. Choose one of the apps from the directories above.
1. Use the app's behavior draft to implement the application. 
1. Keep it really simple!  

## How to run these things?
We will be hosting them on a website soon, so you can see them as we build them. 

Right now, you will need:

* Chrome: Behind a flag. Check at [chromestatus](http://www.chromestatus.com/features/6561526227927040)
* Firefox: [Build for Nightly](http://blog.nikhilism.com/2014/05/serviceworker-implementation-status-in-firefox.html)

**Please note that the spec and implementations are in a very early stage!** You may find issues with implementations in that they may often change or produce strange results at first. To see what actually works in browses today, see: 

* Jake Archibald's [IsServiceWorkerReady](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) page - check fo all implementations

## I wanna build something different!
If you have a more interesting app you want to build, please add them to this repo! Fork the repo, add a directory to the root directory complete with a README.md file explaining the use case in an much detail as you can. Then make a pull request!
