# Simple wiki
This example will demonstrate how a Wiki could use a Service Worker to offer an offline experience, where while off line:

 * the user selects articles they'd like to be available offline.
 * the user can edit article offline. 
 * the user can create an article while offline.

## Initial behaviour draft

* User clicks “read later” on an article for the first time
    * [ ] Bootstrap code and related imagery requests added to cache, this process fails if any request fails
    * [ ] Article html include (different url to article) & device-dependant inline images requests saved, this process fails if any request fails
    * [ ]  Confirmation given when bootstrap and article caching has completed
    * [ ]  Otherwise, meaningful error message displayed (by the site, not browser UI)
* User visits homepage
    * [ ]  Page structure is pulled from bootstrap cache
    * [ ]  Content such as “article of the day” is fetched via XHR
        * [ ]  If XHR fails, unobtrusive message indicating the user is offline is displayed in place of content
    * [ ]  “Available offline” list is populated with articles the user has cached, along with “remove” buttons
* User visits cached article
    * [ ]  Page structure is pulled from bootstrap cache
    * [ ]  Cached content is injected into the content area of the page
    * [ ]  “read later” button displays spinner
    * [ ]  Additional online-only content fetched via XHR, eg login state
        * [ ]  Fails silently, or displays small “offline mode” as login state
    * [ ]  Article html include requested
        * [ ]  If request succeeds, update content on page and replace cached content with new content
        * [ ]  If fails, fail silently
        * [ ]  Remove spinner from “read later” button
* User visits uncached article
    * [ ]  Page requested from the server (normal request behaviour)
        * [ ]  If fails due to network failure (no connection), friendly error message displayed, explaining the user is offline, listing article that are available offline
* On navigate, if a check hasn’t been made for 10 minutes, look for updates to the bootstrap and page templates, update accordingly.
